<h1>BarberShop</h1>

This system was made to manage customer schedules in a barber shop. It does not use a database, but an arrayList.

Development based on the standard MVC architecture using Java JFrames to make the screens.

Project made from a course on youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJIP7GdByOyuBKB--fIO2DoQaPVXm9lCw">Projeto em Java - Barbearia</a>

<b>Credits: </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4mJ2FXeA-RuDbwZA0z_MA">Tiago Luz</a>.
